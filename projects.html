      <h3>Event Guest Seating Planner (Web Tool)</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Designer & Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a simple planning tool to organize guest seating for an event in a clear, efficient way.</p>
      <p>
        I designed and built a small web application using <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> and JavaScript
        to help plan where guests will sit at different tables. I focused on making the layout easy
        to read and updating the information in a way that reduces confusion and double-checking.
        The project simulates a <strong>real business scenario</strong> where someone needs to coordinate people,
        space, and logistics so the event runs smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Management-related skills demonstrated:</strong> planning and organizing information,
        thinking about user needs, attention to detail, and using technology to support event and
        operations management.

      <h3>Customer Transaction & Probability Simulation (Dice Project)</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Use a probability simulation to understand random outcomes and practice logical thinking similar to basic business scenarios.</p>
      <p>
        In this project, I built an interactive dice-rolling web page with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
        The logic behind the simulation helped me think about variability and outcomes, similar to
        <strong>risk assessment</strong> and scenario planning in business. I also debugged issues with image paths
        and event triggers, strengthening my troubleshooting skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Management-related skills demonstrated:</strong> analytical thinking, problem-solving,
        identifying patterns in outcomes, and approaching tasks systematically.

      <h3>Teen Program Coordination – Skyline Library Internship</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Program Assistant & Event Coordinator</p>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Support the planning, organization, and delivery of weekly teen programs while maintaining smooth library operations.</p>

      <p>
         I helped <strong>coordinate</strong> weekly teen programs
        serving 20–40 participants. I assisted with <strong>planning</strong> activities, preparing materials,
        managing setup and cleanup, and interacting with teens during sessions. I also handled
        <strong>administrative tasks</strong> such as inventory, documentation, and attendance tracking to keep
        the program organized.
      </p>

      <p>
        This experience gave me hands-on practice in scheduling, time management, coordinating
        resources, and ensuring activities ran smoothly. I learned to communicate with diverse
        groups, adapt quickly when plans changed, and maintain a positive environment even
        during busy program hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Management-related skills demonstrated:</strong> event planning, coordination,
        communication, task organization, operations support, and leadership.
